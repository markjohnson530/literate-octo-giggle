<h3>Commands: <span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px;">See <a href="https://f68.space/commands">here</a></span></h3>

<h3>World Modifications:</h3><ul>
<li>The world border is set to <b>1 million</b> in each direction from <b>0,0</b>. This is significantly smaller than the default 30 million, but big enough to allow for impressive builds to be created that can realistically remain undiscovered for years.</li>
<li>Phantoms <b>do not naturally spawn</b> but spawn eggs can be purchased with <span style="color:#035700;">in-game money</span> at the shop.</li></ul>

<h3>Dragon Egg Event:</h3><ul>
<li>Every <b>Saturday</b> at <b>7pm EST</b>, a Dragon Egg is generated in a random location within 20,000 blocks of spawn. The coordinates are publicly released in chat and the discord.</li></ul>

<h3>Currency:</h3>
<ul>In-game money can be obtained on the server by selling cobblestone using <b>/sell</b>. You cannot sell any other item.
<br><div style="font-size:12px;">Any use of the terms “money,” “$,” or equivalent within this server refers exclusively to an in-game, fictional currency used for entertainment and gameplay purposes. This virtual currency is not real money, carries no cash value, and cannot be exchanged, converted, redeemed, or traded for real-world currency, goods, or services.</div></ul>

<h3>Stone Miner Scoreboard:</h3>
<ul>The Stone Miner scoreboard is a leaderboard seperated from money featuring the top ten players that have mined the most stone. Commands regarding this can be found in the Command section.</ul>
