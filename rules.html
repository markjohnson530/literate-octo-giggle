<h3> Server Rules </h3>

<b style="font-size:20px;">1.</b> Hacking, cheating, or using mods that give gameplay leverage over other players are <b>not allowed</b> and may result in a jail or ban. <span style="color:#035700;">Mods that are allowed include such as OptiFine / other performance improvement mods, Armor and effect status HUD mods, or purely aesthetic mods.</span>
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">2.</b> Do not spam chat or use hate speech, slurs, or other excessively offensive language.
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">3.</b> Using bugs, glitches, or attempting to use unintended server mechanics is not allowed. <span style="color:#035700;">The only exception is carpet duplicators, and Primed TnT duplication for the sake of farming. (Both must be within reason and this is not guarenteed to last.)</span>
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">4.</b> Advertising or promoting other servers/websites is not allowed.
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">5.</b> Griefing and raiding are allowed on this server.
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">6.</b> Do not share share personal information and/or identities of others without their explicit permission. i.e., doxxing.
<br><br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">7.</b> <span style="color:#9e0000;">Immoral behavior that may not be specifically mentioned in these rules can be acted upon. Moderators reserve discretion for retroactive rule enforcement; just because a rule does not exist, or a loophole does exist, does not mean you will not be banned for it.</span>
<br><br>
Breaking any of these rules will be judged on a fair case-by-case basis and moderators have discretion to utilize any of the server's 3 main punishments: a ban, jail, or mute.
